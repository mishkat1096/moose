# Compute Block Rotated Elasticity Tensor

!syntax description /Materials/ComputeBlockRotatedElasticityTensor

## Description

The material `ComputeBlockRotatedElasticityTensor` is used for running Polycrystalline mechanics simulations
with pre-meshed grain structures where each grain is assigned with unique block ID, we need a
elasticity tensor class that provides rotated elasticity tensor taking EulerAngles from an
EulerAngleProvider based on the current block ID, this .  `ComputeBlockRotatedElasticityTensor`
takes two constants provided by the user and a user object in the form of EulerAngleProvider.

Following the design of compute rotated elasticity tensor which is used for GrainTracker based simulations,
but using `_current_elem->subdomain_id()` instead of grain ID for looking up the euler angles.

The fill method `symmetric9` is appropriate for materials with three orthotropic planes of symmetry
[citep!malvern1969introduction], and is often used for simulations of anistropic materials such as
cubic crystals.  The enginering elasticity tensor notation, [eq:rank4tensor_aux_indices],
for an orthotropic material is given in [eq:symmetric9_fill_method]
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:symmetric9_fill_method}
C_{ijkl}^{orthotropic} = \begin{bmatrix}
              C_{11} & C_{12} & C_{13} &      0 &      0 &      0 \\
              C_{12} & C_{22} & C_{23} &      0 &      0 &      0 \\
              C_{13} & C_{23} & C_{33} &      0 &      0 &      0 \\
                   0 &      0 &      0 & C_{44} &      0 &      0 \\
                   0 &      0 &      0 &      0 & C_{55} &      0 \\
                   0 &      0 &      0 &      0 &      0 & C_{66}
              \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
